# Computational Morphology
Computational morphology deals with developing techniques and theories for the computational analysis and synthesis of word forms.  
Morphology is the study of the mental system involved in word formation, and of words, their internal structure and their formal relationships.

Language consists of signs, which have form (the sound or spelling) and meaning (the association with some entity). A sign has iconic (literal) and indexical (connotative) meaning.  
Symbols are signs where the connection between the form and meaning is arbitrary.

Morphology is needed in order to account for *possible* word forms, and not just attested ones.  
It is of two kinds – inflectional and derivational.

Many languages work with affixes (prefixes, suffixes, infixes, or circumfixes) for inflection and derivation. However, some languages exhibit non-concatenative phenomena, where wordforms are created by combining a root and a template.

Morphemes may have *allomorphs*, which can be phonologically conditioned, lexically conditioned, or suppletive.
